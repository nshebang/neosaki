Neosaki
===

Neosaki is a selfhostable "anonymous" file uploader and a rewrite of
[Sakisafe](https://github.com/rfc-2549/sakisafe) in Golang. The main
distribution of Neosaki is not project-agnostic out of the box and it was
primarily made for the Spanish-speaking nonprofit project
[Ichoriaâ˜…org](https://ichoria.org/), however, it is possible to edit
the default HTML views to adapt the software to your project if you want.

Differences between Sakisafe and Neosaki
---

* Neosaki supports multiple file uploading
* Neosaki has automatic rate limiting
* Neosaki is written in Go 
* Neosaki has more detailed logging
* Neosaki bans files by their MIME types, not by their extensions 
* Et cetera

How to install
---

1. You can either grab a [release with a precompiled binary](https://github.com/nshebang/neosaki/releases)
or compile Neosaki yourself. You just need to install Golang 1.22+ and run
`go build uploader/main.go`. 

2. Copy `dotenv` to `.env`. Neosaki won't work without an .env file, you
should change the port from this file if you need to.

3. Run the binary and your Neosaki server is ready!

Q&A
---

### Is it possible to migrate from Sakisafe to Neosaki?

Yeah, just move the old users' files (`f/*`) from the Sakisafe directory to
the Neosaki directory and that's it.

### Is this compatible with sakisafecli?

Probably not. You can use cURL instead.

### Can I enable CORS?

Yes. You should do this from the nginx site file.
